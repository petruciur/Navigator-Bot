# Navigator-Bot

Ever felt frained and bored doing repretitive tasks every time theyw wis to log into a website?

If you provide the credentials, out bot accesses the desktop version Tinder and passes through all the intermediate webpages in order to login to the website. 
Once it reaches there, it automatically swipes right and is able to work around any pop-ups and delays is website response times, without the need of user supervision or input.
The bot does not crash but will end once the user exits the browser.

In order to run the bot, execute the following in Shell:

function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
